Scrum Evaluation:
We found one impediment to be the data safety preserving to be an issue when we collaborate with IS&T.
It is preventing us to develop one of the feature for G1. In order to resolve this issue, we plan to set a meeting with 
IS&T to specify details and start coding under guidance.

# Sprint Review
We conducted multiple meetings with our mentors and IS&T to discuss details and reached to some conclusion for data access.
Frontend framework is tbd and will set during the Monday class. We are meeting the requirements to start building G1 A and under
mentoring hope to finish G1 A by the end of next week.
