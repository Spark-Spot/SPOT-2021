# Sprint Planning 1: (pre-construction for G1 A)
1. Meeting with IS&T
2. Determine the backend language
3. Construct a new backend repo

Rationale: Focus on adjustment and data preservation from the IS&T side.

# Daily Scrum (02/26)
John Chai: Constructed backend using node and express; will establish connection to database as the next task

Preksha Munot: Research on BU authentication and front-end frameworks; plan to start constructing landing page base on design

Evan Hsu: Constructed backend using node and express; start drafting database structure base on IS&T database

Tilak Agarwal: Research on BU authentication and front-end frameworks; plan to start constructing landing page base on design

Scrum Evaluation:
We found one impediment to be the data safety preserving to be an issue when we collaborate with IS&T.
It is preventing us to develop one of the feature for G1. In order to resolve this issue, we plan to set a meeting with 
IS&T to specify details and start coding under guidance.


# Sprint Review 1
We conducted multiple meetings with our mentors and IS&T to discuss details and reached to some conclusion for data access.
Frontend framework is tbd and will set during the Monday class. We are meeting the requirements to start building G1 A and under
mentoring hope to finish G1 A by the end of next week.




# Sprint Planning 2: (construction for G1 A)
1. Meeting with Prasad (database access and construction).
2. Constructed api to pull data from IS&T successfully.
3. Design update (UXD).
4. Added Descriptions on frontend.

Rationale: We plan to (forecast) to mainly focus on completing G1 A as much as possible since it takes up 3 story points: updating the existing codebase and get the data for development purpose. We are waiting on Dharmesh to build the server so we constructed connections first with IS&T. Updated some front-end for building info. We are able to retreive the data.


# Daily Scrum (03/05)
John Chai: Meeting with IS&T and able to construct api calls to retreive data periodically from IS&T database; will do more research on web sockets and database construction.

Preksha Munot: Updated Understanding Presentation according to the feedback from mentors; updated some of the UI; will focus on the debugging and updating.

Evan Hsu: Meeting with Prassad, discussed workflow of the database; tested api calls through postman; will start building testing runs to ensure the quality of the code written.

Tilak Agarwal: Validation Exercises, summarizes findings from the surveys; updated some of the UI; will focus on the debugging and updating.

Katie So: Updated the current figma design and the design brief; keep updating the design and communication with development teams.

Scrum Evaluation:
We found some impediments to be the different database server different mentors suggested but we are able to finalize our decision in order to preserve data safety. We also notice that the frontend team need to focus on debugging as well as the previous codes have some issues.
In order to resolve this issue, we plan to set more meetings between the frontend developers and the mentors to get more used to the language and weekly coding sessions. Evidence can be found in the Google Drive Week 6 folder (a screenshot of our weekly coding session where we discussed functions to write)

Mob-Programming: the evidence can be found in the drive Week 6 folder.
Test-Driven Development: included in our code as the format of console.log() to validate the retrieval of data, marked in our updated backend code repository.

# Sprint Review 2
We obtained a working software and able to run the app server on localhost. In order to run the app, pls go to the private repository (https://github.com/Spark-Spot/Spot) and follow the readme there to see how to set up the environment and run the app. We showed our mentor Prassad and Rohit we are able to make acheivement on the backend. We finalized every stack with mentors and are able to construct the core of the backend and mange to handle continous data refreshing which is a great acheivement. We also updated some front-end code using the mocking data. We completed 70% of the G1 with some remaining front-end work to be updated. In general the developement process is moving smoothly; improvements are more meeting and coding sessions during the week since it is the beginning of the development.

# Sprint Retrospective
Improvements and feedbacks from the team: Increase communications between team members; Collect small questions during the development progress; Earlier distribution of weekly task. Meeting on Tue for 30min to discuss tasks and plans for the week. (9am-9:30am)
